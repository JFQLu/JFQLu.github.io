### Project Details
This project required collaborative work with 4 other data scientists over 10 weeks where we defined the problem, explored and transformed our data, researched solutions, implemented machine learning models to solve the probelm outlined and presented our deliverables coordinators and other data science peers.
##### Collaborators *Andrew William, Dan Visitchaichan, Daniel Dinh, Michael Li*

#### Background
The Internet of Things (IoT) has been one of the most advanced technologies in our present time. The Internet of Things connects every unit, device, and machinery to a single network. Therefore, it is highly likely to see IoT in many industries due to its convenience in data gathering. However, most of these devices are installed just for the systemâ€™s general needs. They are typically built with limited functions to accomplish simple tasks in different areas. They are vulnerable targets for multiple cyber-attack methods which include DDoS, MITM, and many more [1], making protection measures such as anomaly detection very important.
